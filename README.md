You will need api keys from https://openweathermap.org/api and https://giphy.com/

Gives current weather detail with a GIF based on city and/or country code you search for

You can update this app by going to the api and going through th documentation. 

This project uses JQuery version 3.0.0, but you can use any higher than this. 

You can also do the same without JQuery but then you have to make changes in javascript file which is index.js in this project
and delete the script tag in index.html file which imports jquery (to be on safe side).
